Users can sign up for your WordPress using their crypto wallets. Gate content based on NFTs owned. Web3 authentication plugin supports crypto wallets such as Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Argent, Trust Wallet, Rainbow, Coinomi, Guarda Wallet, Crypto.com DeFi Wallet, Trezor, etc.

== Description ==

The [[Web3 – Crypto wallet Login & NFT token gating](https://plugins.miniorange.com/web3-wordpress-login)] plugin allows users to Sign Up/log in to a WordPress website using their cryptocurrency wallet. It also helps to NFT token gate exclusive content of the WordPress site. Here only users who have specified NFTs in their crypto wallet can access locked content.

To understand the functionality and flow of your Web3 wallet login button, please refer to the Setup Guide [[here](https://developers.miniorange.com/docs/wordpress-web3/features/enable-web3-wallets)].

Our Web3 Authentication plugin uses digital signature verification for crypto login. This increases the security of WordPress crypto login.

During crypto wallet signup, our Web3 plugin creates a regular WordPress user account, so existing plugins, and customizations will continue to work as intended.
